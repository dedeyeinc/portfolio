                <p class="process_text_1">
                    Before delving into the technical challenges or lore of the character, I'd like to say that this
                    character was made during the creation of this entire online
                    portfolio and that this asset, Ibernian Warrior, actually means something to me, unlike other assets
                    I've worked on for other companies or clients,
                    which I took more as an opportunity to grow. So, firstly, I will delve in the technical challenges I
                    faced and the growth I achieved during the creation of this asset.
                    Secondly, I'll talk about the actual background of the character. And lastly, I'll wrap it up with
                    what I'm going to do with characters like this after finishing
                    this portfolio off. Technical challenges, lore, and plans for the future. Let's go!
                </p>

                <p class="process_text_2">
                    I began with the idea to create a new portfolio: coding my own website to showcase my work. It led
                    me to the point where I needed to publish an asset
                    that I had made from scratch. I began this asset with the concept art; the idea of the character,
                    which had been brewing for a while, was one of a
                    world where the land has deep roots in faith and magic. The next challenge was taking the 2D concept
                    and making it the 3D model you see, which will
                    be iterated over, and probably replaced with Metahuman as a base model for the body and face. During
                    the modeling phase, I refreshed quite a bit of
                    my abilities in zbrush. By the end, I was navigating the UI easily, adding in new geometries, like a
                    shirt, underwear, or gloves; I was editing and
                    removing face components I didn't like to transform the new geometries I added, and saving out the
                    tools (model files).
                    For the RIGGING phase (my favorite), I took a library of scripts I've made over the years in Python
                    and MEL, put them in a plugin called Vetala, which is for Maya, and I
                    procedurally auto-rigged my own model. I had to do all the skinning manually, since this was a fresh
                    new model, which is no problem. There were a few challenges
                    during this phase. One of them was an inverted foot roll, which was due to inverted values in some
                    unitConversion and AnimCurveUA nodes. Another was the back
                    and forth between modeling and rigging phases, things forgotten, like UVs, ngons, and more. I used a
                    forgotten code I wrote a couple of years ago and easily
                    solved the challenge. Once the rigging phase was done, it was time to animate the character!
                    I refreshed my animation principles with a walk cycle. I needed something with movement, so that I
                    could add it as a piece to the portfolio. Easily enough,
                    I finished the walk cycle and was faced with one last array of new challenges: exporting everything
                    efficiently, loading the files onto my website, and displaying them in
                    a manner that I haven't seen before. Using my HTML, CSS, JS, and THREE knowledge, I scrapped
                    together this page from a template I made a week before.
                    I added controls for the model and skeleton visibility, animations with blending; lighting with
                    different render options, and more! I had also enabled the
                    download of my rig for anyone to use. If you want, please do so, and enjoy!
                </p>
                <p>
                    PS: I skipped out on the face and kilt rig since I'm currently rushing a bit to get this portfolio
                    done (I'll do them after I publish a few more pieces and remove this little text).

                    The Ibernian Warrior is part of the main tribe in Ibernia, a country in the
                    continent of North Arcanas. Ibernia, like all the other countries, was part of a phenomenon in which
                    they we all in communion with their gods at the exact
                    same time. The land's show of faith had allowed all their Gods to take physical form to walk among
                    their people. The ones that accepted the blessing had fused
                    perfectly with the spirit of the wolf. The ones that did not, either overcame the spirit and
                    ascended to be a hero or were overcome by the spirit and transformed
                    into the animal form - Ibernia being the land of wolves. The Ibernian Warrior is a perfect fusion
                    between man and wolf. One who is quick, strong, and ferocious on the
                    battle field and as a friend. Being able to dodge and avoid attacks, while delivering devastating
                    damage makes them formidable. They also enjoy using team
                    tactics to defeat their enemies or capture their prey, just like a pack of wolves.

                <p>
                    We've gone over the technical challenges and growth, the lore and background of the character, and
                    now it's time to talk about the future! What are the plans
                    for this guy and other characters like him? Well, I'm going to make video games with them - as best
                    as I can! It's what I've wanted to do since I was 13 or 14
                    years old. So, that's what I'll do!
